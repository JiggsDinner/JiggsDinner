- 👋 Hi, I’m @JiggsDinner and I'm an academic who researches, writes, and teaches.
- 👀 I’m interested in the language we use to describe climate change and how that language might influence individuals' thinking and collective action.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning R and Bookdown.
- 💞️ I’m hoping to write a book about climate-change discourse with these tools. 
- 📫 How to reach me is on here, I guess...
